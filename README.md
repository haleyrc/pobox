# pobox (pending a better name)

A barebones router designed specifically for RPC-esque APIs.

Featuring:

- Constant-time route lookups
- Server- and route-level middleware

Not featuring:

- URL parameters
- Regexes
- Advanced routing

This is not meant to be a solution to everyone's routing problems, but rather a
quick solution to my own default routing practices when writing APIs for my own
usage. Use at your own risk.

Bug fixes and suggestions are welcome but I don't have free time to do code
reviews on my side projects so feature PRs will be rejected, no matter
the merit.

I make no backwards compatibility guarantees or really guarantees of any kind.
